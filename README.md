# 📊 RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project demonstrates how to apply RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to customer data to understand customer value and behavior. It segments customers into categories like **Champions**, **Loyal Customers**, **About to Sleep**, and more based on their transactional history.

## 🔍 What is RFM?

- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency (F):** How often they purchase
- **Monetary (M):** How much money they spend

Each customer is scored from 1 to 5 in each category, then grouped into segments like:
- `Champions` (555): Most loyal and high-spending customers
- `Promising Customers`
- `About to Sleep`: At risk of churn
- `Potential Loyalists` and more

## 📂 Files Included

- `rfm_dataset.csv` – RFM dataset with scoring and segments
